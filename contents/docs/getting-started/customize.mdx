To customize this theme, follow these simple steps:

## Choosing the color you want
By default, the color set for the theme is <code>#FFB000</code>. However, this can be changed simply using 3 values. Or the easier way is you ask me on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/t6CKrYvQuE) and I will send you your new custom theme in less than a day.

### Choose your color
1. Go to Google and search `color picker` or click [here](https://g.co/kgs/q5QAo9Z)
2. Pick the color you wish
3. You should see HSL values below, remember them:

## Implementing the color

2. Find `--accent-hue` and replace it with the first value of HSL
3. Find `--accent-saturation` and replace it with the second value of HSL
4. Find `--accent-lightness` and replace it with the second value of HSL
5. Save the theme
